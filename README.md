# basicCNN
A basic convolutional neural network to learn the basics of image classification using deep learning.

This project aims to create and train a simple CNN model (LeNet) to recognize and differentiate digits.
The model will be trained on the MNIST, a popular dataset of digit images.

A UI will be added - to obtain a user drawing input, and test the drawing against the model to predict
what number the user has drawn.
The output: a list of probabilities of digits 1 - 9 that matches the drawn number.
